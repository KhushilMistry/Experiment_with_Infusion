<h2>Experiment With infusion</h2>
<p>This is small app with infusion framework. I have created this app for learning purpose. Main files are <a href="https://github.com/KhushilMistry/Experiment_with_Infusion/tree/master/demos/inlineEdit/WeightConverter">here.</a></p>
<p>This demo apps calculates weight of particular things on different planets. We have to enter weight in Kilogram and choose planet and it will show weight on that perticular planet. Also I am rendering few information about planet with that. i.e, General Information, Gravity(in N/M^2) and Image of that perticular planet.</p>
<p>I am using Rendere Component in infusion to render different things. Also I am using Infusion 2.0 release for this app.</p>
